### Developing my love for: the journey of software building

Challenging. Exciting. At times, frustrating â€” but it's fun and rewarding

To those who have joined and supported me on this continuous journey: **thank you**

To those I have yet to meet: thank you, too

Here's to more hours of stacked compiler errors, missing semicolons, confusion, and small wins along the way.

Sincerely yours,

Brandon
